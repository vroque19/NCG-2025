# NCG-2025: Robotic Tower of Hanoi
Our project aims to create a physical version of the classic mathematical puzzle game, Tower of Hanoi [1]. This system has **physical** rings, towers, and arm to move rings between towers with a goal of solving the game. Additionally, there is a **load cell** under each tower that tracks where the rings are being placed by their weight. The system has a touch screen display for playing the game and 3 main game modes: touch screen mode, manual mode, and automated mode.

## Game Modes
 > Touch screen mode allows for the game to be played only using the touch screen. 
 
 > Manual mode allows for the game to be played through a feature called Tricoder. 
 
 > Automated mode demonstrated the systemâ€™s capabilities of moving the motors, actuating the solenoid and updating the display to solve the game as efficiently as possible (in **N-1** moves, where **N** is the number of rings).
